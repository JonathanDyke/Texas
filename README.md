## Gameplay

Between 2 and 8 players are each given 1000 chips to play with and can bet, raise and re-raise between rounds, as in a normal game of Texas Hold'em. This is an implementation without blinds and without an ante, so if all players fold before the flop a new round is started. 

Each round is completed following either the final round of betting, or when there is only one player left, at which point the chips pot is evenly distributed between the winner(s). Rounds will continue until there is only one player left with chips.
